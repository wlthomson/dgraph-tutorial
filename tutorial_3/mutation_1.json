We are very grateful to have so many people interested in joining our team! We also realized that the job openings were neither really up to date nor covered all of the roles that we are looking for. This is why we decided to spend some time rewriting them and the result is these six new job openings!.",

This round is led by Redpoint Ventures, with investment from our previous lead, Bain Capital Ventures, and participation from all our existing investors â€“ Blackbird, Grok and AirTree. With this round, Satish Dharmaraj joins Dgraphâ€™s board of directors, which includes Salil Deshpande from Bain and myself. Their guidance is exactly what we need as we transition from building a product to bringing it to market. So, thanks to all our investors!.",

Many new users of Dgraph have existing relational databases that they want to migrate from. In particular, we get asked a lot about how to migrate data from MySQL to Dgraph. In this article, we present a tool that makes this migration really easy: all a user needs to do is write a small 3 lines configuration file and type in 2 commands. In essence, this tool bridges one of the best technologies of the 20th century with one of the best ones of the 21st (if you ask us).",
